<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hello! My name is Najima, but most people call me Naji. I am 27 years old and I come from the beautiful country of Azerbaijan. Currently, I am on an exciting journey to become a web developer, focusing on Front End development.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of my greatest passions in life is dogs. I have a delightful Poodle named Cheebu who lives with my family back home in Azerbaijan. I miss Cheebu dearly, and he constantly brings joy to my life, even from afar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This website represents my very first project in web development. I am thrilled to share it with you and hope you find it enjoyable and engaging. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to growing and learning more in this fascinating field.</span></p>
